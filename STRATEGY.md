# Multi-LLM Orchestrator: Strategy & Roadmap

## 1. Vision & Mission
- Vision: What we're building and why it matters
- Mission: Our approach to achieving the vision
- Target audience: Russian developers working with AI
- Unique value proposition: Unified interface for Russian LLMs with smart routing

## 2. Market Analysis
- Current problems:
  - Companies forced to choose between GigaChat/YandexGPT/local models
  - No unified API
  - Complex integration and fallback logic
  - Compliance challenges (152-ФЗ)
- Market opportunity:
  - Russian AI market size: ₽168 billion (2025), growing 45% YoY
  - 10k-50k Python developers working with AI
  - Enterprise demand for import substitution solutions
- Competitive landscape:
  - LangChain (not Russia-focused)
  - Direct API usage (complex, no routing)
  - Whitespace: No unified orchestrator for Russian LLMs

## 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Distribution Channels
1. Developer Communities:
   - Habr (articles, tutorials)
   - Telegram (Russian AI channels)
   - GitHub (opensource)
   - Conferences (Sber Conf, OpenSourceDay, HighLoad)

2. Content Marketing:
   - Technical blog posts (1-2 per month)
   - Video tutorials on YouTube
   - Case studies from early adopters
   - Documentation and guides

3. Partnerships:
   - LLM providers (Yandex, Sber) - official integration
   - Cloud providers (Yandex Cloud, VK Cloud) - marketplace listing
   - System integrators - reseller partnerships

4. Community Building:
   - Active GitHub presence
   - Discord/Telegram community
   - Monthly online meetups
   - Contributors program

### Pricing Strategy
- Freemium core (opensource)
- Managed cloud (SaaS pricing)
- Enterprise support (high-touch sales)
- Consulting services (implementation)

## 5. Success Metrics

### Developer Adoption (Leading Indicators)
- GitHub stars: 100 (Month 1) → 500 (Month 3) → 1000 (Month 6)
- Weekly active users: 50 → 200 → 500
- PyPI downloads: 100/week → 500/week → 2000/week

### Business Metrics (Lagging Indicators)
- Paying customers: 0 → 5 → 20 → 50
- MRR: ₽0 → ₽50k → ₽200k → ₽500k
- Enterprise deals: 0 → 1 → 3 → 5

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage: >70%
- Documentation completeness: >90%
- Issue response time: <24 hours
- PR merge time: <48 hours

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Risk: Yandex/Sber release unified API → Our solution becomes obsolete
  Mitigation: Focus on value-add (routing, observability, compliance)

- Risk: LangChain adds Russian integrations
  Mitigation: Be lightweight and Russia-specific, move faster

### Business Risks
- Risk: Low willingness to pay
  Mitigation: Freemium model, prove value first

- Risk: Cannot compete with enterprise sales
  Mitigation: Partner with integrators, focus on PLG

### Operational Risks
- Risk: Solo founder burnout (1-2 hours/day limit)
  Mitigation: Community-driven development, find co-founder

- Risk: Support overhead kills productivity
  Mitigation: Self-service docs, community support, paid support tier

## 7. Decision Framework

When to pivot:
- <50 GitHub stars after 2 months
- No paying customers after 4 months
- Competitor launches superior solution

When to double down:
- 300+ GitHub stars in first 2 months
- 5+ enterprise inquiries
- Strong organic growth (>20% week-over-week)

When to seek funding/co-founder:
- PMF achieved (40% "very disappointed" metric)
- ₽200k+ MRR with clear path to ₽1M
- Need to scale faster than competition
